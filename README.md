# ⚽ Football-Assistant

**Football Assistant** is a Python app I built that combines **AI** with **live football  data**. It uses [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com/) API to show standings, matches, stats, and more — and connects to **Google Gemini** so you can chat with it about football in real time.
