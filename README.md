# Football-Assistant

**Football Assistant** is a Python app I built that combines **AI** with **live football  data**. It uses [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com/) API to show standings, matches, stats, and more — and connects to **Google Gemini** so you can chat with it about football in real time.

## What It Does

- Ask football questions in natural language (thanks to Gemini)
- Get live data - standings, scorers, fixtures, stats
- Has a simple **GUI** made with PyQt6
- Uses environment variables for API Keys
- Organized code with separate modules for each feature
