# ⚽ Football-Assistant

**Football Assistant** is a Python app I built that combines **AI** with **live football  data**. It uses [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com/) API to show standings, matches, stats, and more — and connects to **Google Gemini** so you can chat with it about football in real time.

## 🎯 What It Does

- 🤖 Ask football questions in natural language (thanks to Gemini)
- 📈 Get live data - standings, scorers, fixtures, stats
- 🖥️ Has a simple **GUI** made with PyQt6
- 🔑 Uses environment variables for API Keys
- 💡 Organized code with separate modules for each feature
